Rendez-Vous	
===========

Rendez-Vous is an iPhone games that tries to show the importance of the several launching parameters of satellites. By playing the game, the user gets familiar with initial speeds and directions to place satellites into orbit.

# Challenge

This application was developed for the International Space Apps challenge from scratch. The chosen challenge is [Reaching for the Stars](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/reach-stars/).

# Gameplay

The gameplay is meant to be very straight forward. At the bottom of the screen there is a big red button to launch a rocket. A rocket takes off and then the user needs to find a good orbital altitude to launch the satellite. Once the rocket gets at the desired altitude, the user swipes the screen with a certain direction and intensity (length of the swipe).

If the intensity, direction and altitude match a possible orbit. Then the user has succeeded.

We thought of possible levels we could implement but didn't get there by the end of the weekend.

Level 1 would be the launching of ISS into a certain orbit.
Level 2 would be the launch of another satellite without colliding with ISS. 
Level 3 would be a rendezvous between ISS and the new satellite. Making it approach ISS without hitting to hard on it.

# Building and Playing

The game is designed for the iPhone using Cocos2D as a game engine and Box2d as physics engine.

To launch the application you need Xcode and to launch it on a device you need an Apple developer account.

If you want to run it in the simulator on a Mac, just download the latest version from our git repo and hit the Run button of Xcode.
